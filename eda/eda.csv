A little later, he announced that a second engine failed, and they still had two left, but it would take 10 hours to get to New York.

Somewhat later, the pilot again came on the intercom and announced that a third engine had died. Never fear, he announced, because the plane could fly on a single engine. However, it would now take 18 hours to get to New York.

At this point, one statistician turned to the other and said, ‚ÄúGee, I hope we don‚Äôt lose that last engine, or we‚Äôll be up here forever!‚Äù"

We usually just used a blank OS image and handled that ourselves, but that seems to be why this is the correct choice.

Beanstalk is really just a load balancer and provisioning service for EC2's, so I guess that makes enough sense to me."

For instance, I can write:
```clojure
(def login-component
  ""Login component elements""
  [(header ""Log into your Quizzard account!"")
   (paragraph ""Please provide your account credentials below."")
   (input-field ""Username"" :username-val meets-username-reqs?)
   (input-field ""Password"" :password-val meets-password-reqs?)
   (and-then validate-login-input)])
```

Which looks like this on the console after getting some user input and executing the `validate-login-input` function:
```
Log into your Quizzard account!

Please provide your account credentials below.
Username: wsingleton
Password: p4$$WORD

Management: Can you add UI content to the curriculum you built so that they can still be marketed as FS devs?
Me: Erm, sure but UI will have to go at the end of the curriculum, otherwise the context switching decreases comfort in their core language
Management: Sure, just put it at the end.

That said, being able to apply for an entry-level developer position out of school is probably not something anyone in my graduating class would have been able to do, because I went to a school for C students."

14999,81573,977674765999439902,0,0,0,"Lol I don't think making good associates is Revature's aim - it's about making MORE associates. In fact, based off what I see happening with training: there's a big push to standardize everything. Which includes not only what trainers teach but how they teach it and in what order they do so.

This ultimately only has one outcome which is to produce an even quality of associate with few outliers.

It seems like it's becoming more important for most associates to be at a certain level (obviously accepting that some will be better and some will be worse), so that clients haven't even expectation for what Revature associates will be.

The part that disappoints me is that we're not focused on trying to make better developers, it's all about making more developers.

The good ol' QUANTITY > QUALITY problem."
15000,81574,977648178088271953,0,0,0,"Revature's whole business model relies on their associates, y'know, actually being good because it incentivizes companies to take them in because of that gold standard"

It's probably person by person basis, but since we all came from the same place, that means we would all have relatively the same skills

But, I will add that I don't think anyone at Revature knows the decision, because of how they operate.

The decision to renew the contract has always been shown to us as something the company just 'decides', and something that isn't an end-all-be-all thing. If worst comes to worst, we will have to go back to Revature's bench and deal with Kahoots for minimum wage, but that would be pretty lame."

If you are on call for 8 hours on Saturday, do you get some time off during the regular working week? Or compensation in some other way.

Because considering like <@747988169571434548> said that it is restricted on call (TIL that was a distinction to make üòÖ), it would be kinda messed up to be working for free.

From what I saw, it seems like you are entitled to at least minimum wage for the restricted hours you are on call but not working, and your regular wage if you have to work. Your state laws could vary, but this seemed to be a common implementation.

So, how are you compensated for this time?"

Non-exempt employees are not allowed to work ‚Äúoff the clock‚Äù even if they want to learn something new, catch up or get ahead. This means coming in early, leaving late, working through lunch, or bringing work home is not permitted, unless it is approved and recorded. Any  employee  who  fails  to  record  or  inaccurately  records  any  hours  worked  will  be  subject  to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. You  should  not  perform  any  work  while  on  a  meal  break  of  30  minutes  or  longer  in  length. Accordingly,  you  should  clock  out  when  taking  a  meal  break  of  30 minutes  or  more.  If  you  are required to perform work by a supervisor or manager during your meal break, you should remain clocked in. It is a violation of Company policy for you to falsify or alter yours or another employee‚Äôs time. Likewise, you may not record time on another employee‚Äôs time record. It is also a violation of Company policy for you or a manager to instruct another employee to incorrectly or falsely report hours. If any manager or employee instructs you to: (1) work off the clock and/or incorrectly or falsely under-or over-report your hours worked; or (2) alter another employee‚Äôs time records to inaccurately or falsely report that employee‚Äôs hours worked, you should report it immediately to your manager or Human Resources.

anyone who has access to oracle time and expense should be able to fill that out (with some guidance in a bit here) and submit that timesheet as an artifact, updating it with an approval when you receive it.

She said the way relocation works is that there are some projects that require it, and that it's a choice. In her words, that is a decision we'll be able to make once we're full time employees, in a year, and that we won't have to do it before then.

For timesheets, she will double check but that we should just do 40 hours, because ""they don't pay their subcontractors extra"".

Do your Hitachi resumes ASAP, ideally before the end of the week"

To complicate matters, people of this type are usually extremely private, and can often be naturally impassive as well, which makes them easy to misread and misunderstand. Perhaps the most fundamental problem, however, is that INTJs really want people to make sense. üôÇ This sometimes results in a peculiar naivete', paralleling that of many Fs -- only instead of expecting inexhaustible affection and empathy from a romantic relationship, the INTJ will expect inexhaustible reasonability and directness."""
